### Try To Break It
I have done my best to account for all possibilities regarding the user prompts and how one could respond to them, and I have a couple "easter eggs" you may come across if you respond in certain ways. I encourage you to try to "break" the game as a user, and if you succeed, share with me how you did it so I can fix it.

> A side note: I know this code is not the prettiest sight. I did the majority of this app in my first week using C#, and I haven't been able to bring myself to rewrite the whole thing just to look nicer. At least the functionality works great!
